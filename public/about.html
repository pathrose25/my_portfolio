<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>People are at the heart of everything I do personally and professionally and I am passionate about building relationships and helping others succeed.
</p>

<p>As a Certified Customer Success Professional with 4+ years of experience in the Healthcare and Energy Industry, I thrive in fast-paced environments. Starting my career at a startup taught me to adapt quickly and grow into a well-rounded customer-facing professional.

In my first role, I led a 10-member cross-functional team to develop and launch digital healthcare solutions for patients with chronic conditions. These solutions, deployed in 10+ European countries, improved patient outcomes while ensuring alignment between customer needs and product goals.

Today, I manage a portfolio of 30+ global energy companies, helping them achieve their goals through digital transformation. From onboarding, training and product adoption, I work to optimize their experience and deliver measurable value. Together, we’re contributing to the mission of transforming how we power the planet, a challenge I’m proud to embrace.

I focus on delivering results in customer retention, health monitoring, and experience optimization while leveraging tools like Salesforce, Gainsight, and Power BI. Whether it's driving growth, solving problems, or sharing insights, I’m always eager to connect. Let’s chat!</p>
